# Bayesian Basket Trading

A quantitative trading system implementing Bayesian methods for basket trading strategies. This project leverages probabilistic modeling and statistical inference to make informed trading decisions on portfolios of assets.

## 📋 Overview

Bayesian Basket Trading uses Bayesian statistics to:
- Model uncertainty in asset returns and correlations
- Update beliefs as new market data arrives
- Optimize portfolio allocations based on posterior distributions
- Implement robust risk management through probabilistic frameworks

## ✨ Features

- **Bayesian Portfolio Optimization**: Use prior beliefs and market data to optimize basket allocations
- **Dynamic Risk Management**: Continuously update risk estimates as new information arrives
- **Correlation Modeling**: Model and update correlations between assets using Bayesian methods
- **Backtesting Framework**: Test strategies on historical data
- **Uncertainty Quantification**: Quantify and incorporate uncertainty into trading decisions

## 💻 Usage

```python
from src.models.bayesian_model import BayesianBasketModel
from src.strategies.basket_strategy import BasketTradingStrategy

# Initialize model
model = BayesianBasketModel(assets=['AAPL', 'GOOGL', 'MSFT'])

# Update with market data
model.update_priors(historical_data)

# Get optimal allocation
allocation = model.optimize_portfolio()

# Execute strategy
strategy = BasketTradingStrategy(model)
signals = strategy.generate_signals(current_prices)
```

## 📊 Methodology

This project implements Bayesian inference for financial time series, including:

1. **Prior Specification**: Define prior beliefs about returns, volatilities, and correlations
2. **Likelihood Modeling**: Model asset returns using appropriate distributions
3. **Posterior Inference**: Update beliefs using Bayes' theorem
4. **Decision Making**: Use posterior distributions for portfolio optimization
